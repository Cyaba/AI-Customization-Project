# AI-Customization-Project

## Objective
To customize MiniX, an empathetic AI assistant, to streamline log analysis while maintaining a professional, friendly, and secure user interaction. The goal is to create a user-centric AI that guides users through log analysis with clarity, empathy, and confidence.

### Skills Learned
- AI behavior customization and prompt engineering
- Designing human-centered AI interactions
- Data interpretation and summarization
- Empathy-driven communication in AI responses
- Documentation and demonstration of AI workflows

### Tools Used
- MiniX AI platform
- Text Cortex for generating and refining AI prompts and responses
- Markdown for project documentation
- Screenshot and screen recording tools
- Text editors (e.g., VS Code, Notepad)

## Steps
- Define Objectives: Determine how MiniX should greet users, confirm names, and interact empathetically.
- Establish Interaction Rules: Decide how MiniX handles different log types, confirms inputs, and assures data privacy.
- Collect Sample Interactions: Use real-world scenarios like security logs or network errors to create test conversations.
- Use Text Cortex: Generate and refine prompts and responses to ensure the AI communicates clearly, confidently, and empathetically.
- Test Conversations: Simulate user interactions to verify MiniX asks for context, confirms inputs, and provides concise summaries.
- Iterate and Improve: Adjust prompts and rules based on test results to ensure clarity, empathy, and precision.
